QLOCKWORK
An advanced firmware for a DIY "word-clock".
******************************************************************************

Qlockwork is an ESP8266 (NodeMCU or WeMos D1 mini) firmware (under GPL license) for a so called "word-clock".

The clock adjusts the time and date once every hour via NTP with a time server on the Internet.
If an RTC is installed, the time of the ESP is also set from the RTC every minute.

At startup the clock performs a short self test.
The sequence of the colors should be: red, green, blue and white. If not, your LED driver setup is wrong.
The clock also shows the local IP address it received via DHCP.
Use this address in a browser to access the clocks web site to set it up.

WiFi manager: If the clock can not connect to any WLAN at startup, it turns on an access point.
Connect a mobile phone or tablet to the AP and enter the WLAN credentials. A white "WiFi" is shown on the clock.
On success there are three short beeps and "WiFi" will be green.
If no WLAN is connected or the timeout has expired, there is a long beep and "WiFi" turns red.
After the WLAN timeout the clock works without NTP but you can still control it via its AP.
Without WLAN the clock uses the optional RTC to set the time or if no RTC is present has to be set manually.
In either ways the clocks IP is shown as a textfeed.

Events can be shown every five minutes on a particular day of the year as a textfeed.
You can set them in "Events.h". Expand the array with events as shown in the default values.
You can set a color for every event. Do not change the first entry.
There is no comma behind the last entry.

Updates of the firmware could be uploaded via USB, OTA or the clocks webserver.
You will find more help and information on how to configure and compile the firmware in "Readme.md" in the zip-archive.
You will also find a circuit diagram, a partslist and some pictures in the "/misc" directory.
All sensors, the RTC and the buzzer are optional.
The clock will run with the ESP8266 module only. No PCB needed.

Warning:    Do not power up the clock from USB only.
            This would blow up the ESP or even the USB port because of high power demand of the LED stripe.
            Always use an external 5V powersupply with at least 4A.

Disclaimer: Qlockwork uses lots of third party libraries.
            I can not guarantee the integrity of these libraries.
            You use the Qlockwork firmware at your own risk.

event_t events[]                    Display a textfeed on a particular day of the year.
                                    The format of an entry in the array is:
                                    { month, day, "Text to display.", year, color },
                                    The last entry has no comma at the end.
                                    Year will be used to calculate an age. "present year" - year = age.
                                    '0' will not show an age.
                                    There can only be one event a day.
                                    The possible colors are:
                                    WHITE, RED, RED_25, RED_50, ORANGE, YELLOW, YELLOW_25, YELLOW_50, GREENYELLOW,
                                    GREEN, GREEN_25, GREEN_50, MINTGREEN, CYAN, CYAN_25, CYAN_50, LIGHTBLUE, BLUE,
                                    BLUE_25, BLUE_50, VIOLET, MAGENTA, MAGENTA_25, MAGENTA_50, PINK.
                                    Do not change the first entry.
